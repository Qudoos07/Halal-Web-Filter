# 🛡️ Halal Web Filter (Chrome Extension)

> **Promoting a Safer, Ethical Internet Experience.**

## 🌟 Project Overview
The **Halal Web Filter** is a custom cybersecurity tool built for Google Chrome. It actively scans web pages in real-time to detect and warn users about content that contradicts Islamic ethical guidelines.

Using the **DOM (Document Object Model) API** and **JavaScript**, this extension analyzes text content for keywords related to:
- 🎲 **Gambling** (Casino, Betting, Lottery)
- 💰 **Riba** (Interest-based loans, Usury)
- 🍷 **Illicit Substances** (Alcohol, Pork, Intoxicants)

When harmful content is detected, a **Red Warning Banner** is injected at the top of the page to alert the user immediately.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project demonstrates proficiency in **Browser Extension Development** and **DOM Manipulation**
- **Manifest V3:** Adheres to the latest Chrome extension security standards.
- **Content Scripts:** Runs isolated JavaScript on visited pages to parse text without compromising privacy.
- **DOM Injection:** Dynamically creates and inserts HTML elements (Warning Banner) into the active webpage.
- **Efficiency:** Uses lightweight string matching to ensure zero lag while browsing.

## 🤝 Purpose & Motivation
I developed this tool to align my technical skills with my values. In an era where online content is unregulated this tool serves as a digital enjoiner of good and forbidder of evil (Amr bil Ma'ruf wa Nahy an al Munkar). It represents my goal to use Computer Science for the benefit of the Muslim Ummah.
